# Test Document for Knowledge Base

## Introduction

This is a test document to verify that the RAG system works correctly.

## Key Information

- The capital of France is Paris
- Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum
- Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence
- The speed of light is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second

## Technical Details

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combines:

1. Document retrieval from a knowledge base
2. Context injection into LLM prompts
3. Generation of informed responses

## Testing Instructions

To test this system:

- Ask: "What is the capital of France?"
- Ask: "Who created Python?"
- Ask: "What is machine learning?"

Expected behavior: The system should retrieve this document and answer based on the information above.
